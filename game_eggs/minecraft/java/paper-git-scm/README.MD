# Paper Git SCM

Paper is the next generation of Minecraft server, compatible with Spigot plugins and offering uncompromising performance.

Check out the [Paper Website](https://papermc.io/) for more information.

This egg allows users to pull source code from a git repository. This does not pull Paper's git repo.

To update a git repository, reinstall the server. This will also pull the latest paper.

## Server Ports

The minecraft server requires a single port for access (default 25565) but plugins may require extra ports to enabled for the server.

| Port  | default |
|-------|---------|
| Game  | 25565   |
